        "\n",
        "I've now come to a stage to do some more machine learning (ML) work after reading a few peer-reviewed papers about ML and drug discovery. It seemed that traditional ML methods were still indispensible performance-wise, and when used in combination with deep learning neural networks, they tend to increase prediction accuracy more. I also haven't ventured into the practicality and usefulness of large language models in drug discovery yet, but I'm aware work in this area has been started. However, comments from experienced seniors did mention that they are still very much novel and therefore may not be as useful yet. Although by the speed of how things evolve in the so-called \"AI\" field, this possibly may change very soon. Also from what I can imagine, molecular representations in texts or strings are not quite the same as natural human language texts, since there are a lot of other chemistry-specific features to consider, e.g. chiralities, aromaticities and so on. Because of this, I'm sticking with learning to walk first by trying to cover conventional ML methods in a more thorough way, before trying to run in the deep learning zone.\n",
        "\n",
        "So this leads to this series of posts (3 in total) about decision tree. Previously, I've only lightly touched on a commonly used classifier algorithm, logistic regression, as the first series in the ML realm. Reflecting back, I think I could've done a more thorough job during the data preparation stage. So this would be attempted this time. The data preparation used here was carried out with strong reference to the materials and methods section in this paper [@vantilborg2022], which was one of the papers I've read. There are probably other useful methods out there, but this paper made sense to me, so I've adopted a few of their ways of doing things during data preprocessing.\n",

        "\n",
        "##### **Data retrieval**\n",
        "\n",
        "This time I decided to try something new which was to use the ChEMBL web resource client to collect data (i.e. not by direct file downloads from ChEMBL website, although other useful way could be through SQL queries, which is also on my list to try later). I found this great online resource about fetching data this way from the TeachOpenCADD talktorial on [compound data acquisition](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/talktorials/T001_query_chembl.html). The data retrieval workflow used below was mainly adapted from this talktorial with a few changes to suit the selected dataset and ML model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The web resource client was supported by the ChEMBL group and was based on a Django QuerySet interface. Their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chembl/chembl_webresource_client) might explain a bit more about it, particularly the Jupyter notebook link provided in the repository would help a lot regarding how to write code to search for specific data.\n",

        "To do this, a few libraries needed to be loaded first."

        "When I reached the second half of data preprocessing, an alarm bell went off regarding using half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in ChEMBL. I remembered reading recent blog posts by Greg Landrum about using [IC50](https://greglandrum.github.io/rdkit-blog/posts/2023-06-12-overlapping-ic50-assays1.html) and inhibition constant ([Ki](https://greglandrum.github.io/rdkit-blog/posts/2023-06-17-overlapping-Ki-assays1.html)) values from ChEMBL. A useful open-access paper [@Kalliokoski2013a] from 2013 also looked into this issue about using mixed IC50 data in ChEMBL, and provided a thorough overview about how to deal with situations like this. There was also another paper [@Kramer2012] on mixed Ki data from the same author group in 2012 that touched on similar issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarise both the paper about IC50 and blog posts mentioned above:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   it would be the best to check the details of assays used to test the compounds to ensure they were aligned and not extremely heterogeneous, since IC50 values were very assay-specific, and knowing that these values were extracted from different papers from different labs all over the world, mixing them without knowing was definitely not a good idea\n",
        "\n",
        "-   the slightly better news was that it was more likely okay to combine Ki values for the same protein target from ChEMBL as they were found to be adding less noise to the data (however ideally similar data caution should also apply)\n",
        "\n",
        "-   it was also possible to mix Ki values with IC50 values, but the data would need to be corrected via using a conversion factor of 2.0 to convert Ki values to IC50 values (note: I also wondered if this needed to be re-looked again since this paper was published 10 years ago...)\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of this, I decided to stick with Ki values only for now before adding more complexities as I wasn't entirely confident about mixing IC50 values with Ki values yet. Firstly, I checked for all types of units being used in bioact_df. There were numerous different units and formats, which meant they would need to be converted to nanomolar (nM) units first."
