        "I've explored a few different ways to compute molecular descriptors, essentially RDKit was used as the main library to do this (there might be other options via other programming languages, but I was only exploring RDKit-based methods via Python for now). A [blog post](https://drzinph.com/rdkit_2d-descriptors-in-python-part-4/) I've come across on calculating RDKit 2D molecular descriptors has explained it well, it gave details about how to bundle the functions together in a class (the idea of building a small library yourself to be used in projects was quite handy). I've also read RDKit's documentations and also the ones from Datamol. So rather than re-inventing the wheels of all the RDKit code, I've opted to use only a small chunk of RDKit code as a demonstration, then followed by Datamol's version to compute the 2D descriptors, since there were already a few really well-explained blog posts about this. One of the examples was this useful [descriptor calculation tutorial](https://greglandrum.github.io/rdkit-blog/posts/2022-12-23-descriptor-tutorial.html) by Greg Landrum.\n",

One of the possible reasons for this could be that some of the descriptors had zeros generated as results for some of the compounds, and when combining dataframes using Pandas code like the ones mentioned here, they might cause unexpected results (as suggested by Pandas, these code were not exactly equivalent to SQL joins). So I looked into different ways, and while there were no other common columns for both dataframes, the index column seemed to be the only one that correlated both.\n",

I was also planning on extending this series to add more trees to the model, that is, from one tree (decision tree), to multiple trees (random forests), and then hopefully move on to boosted trees (XGBoost and LightGBM).
